:summary: Changes in Bootstrap 5. 

Why was jQuery removed from Bootstrap?
****************************************

Mark Otto, the founder of Bootstrap has written:

"We’re sharpening our focus on building tools that are more future-friendly, and while we’re not fully there yet, the promise of CSS variables, faster JavaScript, fewer dependencies, and better APIs certainly feel right to us.

jQuery brought unprecedented access to complex JavaScript behaviors to millions (billions?) of people over the last decade and a half. Personally, I’m forever grateful for the empowerment and support it gave me to continue writing front-end code, learning new things, and embracing plugins from the community. Perhaps most importantly, it’s forever changed JavaScript itself, and that in itself is a monument to jQuery’s success. Thank you to every jQuery contributor and maintainer who made that possible for folks like me.

Thanks to advancement made in front-end development tools and browser support, we’re now able to drop jQuery as a dependency, but you’d never notice otherwise."

Why was support for IE 10 and IE11 dropped?
********************************************

The above answer also applies here:

"We’re sharpening our focus on building tools that are more future-friendly, and while we’re not fully there yet, the promise of CSS variables, faster JavaScript, fewer dependencies, and better APIs certainly feel right to us.

Will migration from v4 to v5 be easy?
*************************************

It will certainly be easier than migrating from v3 to v4. There are definitely fewer syntax changes this time, and backward compatibility is much better guaranteed.
