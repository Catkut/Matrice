<h2>Why was jQuery removed from Bootstrap?</h2>
<p>Mark Otto, the founder of Bootstrap has written:</p>
<p>&quot;We’re sharpening our focus on building tools that are more future-friendly, and while we’re not fully there yet, the promise of CSS variables, faster JavaScript, fewer dependencies, and better APIs certainly feel right to us.</p>
<p>jQuery brought unprecedented access to complex JavaScript behaviors to millions (billions?) of people over the last decade and a half. Personally, I’m forever grateful for the empowerment and support it gave me to continue writing front-end code, learning new things, and embracing plugins from the community. Perhaps most importantly, it’s forever changed JavaScript itself, and that in itself is a monument to jQuery’s success. Thank you to every jQuery contributor and maintainer who made that possible for folks like me.</p>
<p>Thanks to advancement made in front-end development tools and browser support, we’re now able to drop jQuery as a dependency, but you’d never notice otherwise.&quot;</p>

<div class="section" id="will-migration-from-v4-to-v5-be-easy">
<h2>Will migration from v4 to v5 be easy?</h2>
<p>It will certainly be easier than migrating from v3 to v4. There are definitely fewer syntax changes this time, and backward compatibility is much better guaranteed.</p>
